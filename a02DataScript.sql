"Autonomous unmanned vehicle networks in civil applications are considered with increasing interest. Such networks are
envisioned to consist of wireless sensors, robots and unmanned (aerial, ground, underwater) vehicles and are being
used in environmental monitoring, border surveillance, network provisioning, delivery, construction, emergency or
disaster assistance. The challenges in the design of these networks range from physical control of the vehicles,
navigation, to communication limitations. Due to diverse and interdisciplinary nature of these challenges, algorithms
and design principles proposed by networking, robotics, control theory, computer vision and artificial intelligence
research communities will need to be utilized.
IAUV aims to bring together state-of-the-art contributions on the design, specification and implementation of
architectures, algorithms and protocols for current and future applications of autonomous unmanned vehicle networks,
with a special focus o");

technology aims to enable a network to be programmable in a way that makes the network more flexible, scalable, and

properties. Thus far, two widely adopted solutions have been Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function
Virtualization (NFV). Both SDN and NFV have become key enabling technologies for 5G networks and can be widely
applicable to a range of important domains, including cloud datacenters, IoT, mobile edge computing (MEC), smart grid,
